# SENSOR_HUB-IoT-miniproject

In today's world, the rampant industrialization, burgeoning population, and increasing consumerism have propelled environmental degradation to alarming levels. Pollution, in its myriad forms, poses a grave threat to our planet's well-being. To combat this pressing issue, we present SensorHUB â€” a pioneering solution designed to revolutionize IoT development and address the complexities of environmental monitoring.

## Features

1.	Sensor Integration: Connect temperature, humidity, pollution, and light level sensors to a central Sensor Hub.
2.	Data Logging: Implement periodic data logging from sensors to an IoT Cloud platform.
3.	Real-time Monitoring: Enable real-time monitoring of sensor data through the IoT Cloud interface.
4.	Alert System: Implement an alert system in the IoT Cloud platform for abnormal sensor readings, ensuring prompt attention to critical environmental conditions.
